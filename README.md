## Desscription
    I WANT to create an app that helps me generate ReadMe.md every time I do a new project.

    WHEN I open the app 
    THEN questions about the project I'm working on appear

    WHEN I finish answering the questions
    THEN the input data will be used to create a ReadMe.md 

    WHEN i enter the title of the project 
    THEN it become the title of the readme

    WHEN i enter my github username 
    THEN it becomes my github URL

    WHEN i select the license 
    THEN it will also become my Badge
